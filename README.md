# FEND Restaurant reviews project

## Project Overview: 

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project [a static webpage](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) was converted into a mobile-ready web application. I had to take a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I had to also add a service worker to create a seamless offline experience for the users.

## Run Application on localhost
1. Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Open *__command prompt__* (windows) or *__terminal__* (mac)
3. Navigate to desired directory in *__command prompt__* (windows) or *__terminal__* (mac)
4. Run the following command: 
```
  git clone https://github.com/befflus/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git
```
* This command creates a __mws-restaurant-stage-1__ folder
5. Open the __mws-restaurant-stage-1__ direcotry within *__command prompt__* (windows) or *__terminal__* (mac)

6. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

7. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
